# AirBnB Amsterdam: Listings market structure analysis

### Objective
The project objective was to analyze Amsterdam's Airbnb listings to identify patterns and trends in customer preferences and property characteristics. We aimed to segment the listings into distinct groups based on factors such as price, accommodations, and review scores. This information could help hosts optimize their offerings and provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to a successful Airbnb listing.
